# Music Search Engine Project

## Goal
Create a music search engine with the following that allows users to query an artist/song. Must have the following:

1) Wikipedia excerpt <br>
2) Spotify Playlist<br>
3) Twitter tweets about artist<br>
4) Recommendation System<br>

The Frontend will be written for you. Your job is to create an API proxy for Wikipedia, Spotify, and Twitter, and to also write a
recommendation system based on these features.

## Backend

You will need to pipe data to the frontend using Django Templating. Read about it here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/templates/

If you have extra time, you can also deploy live to Heroku. Read about it here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-python

If you have extra time, you can also implement Caching. Read about it here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/cache/
