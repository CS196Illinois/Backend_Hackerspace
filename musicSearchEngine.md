# Music Search Engine Project

## Goal
Create a music search engine with the following that allows users to query an artist/song. Must have the following:

1) Wikipedia excerpt
2) Spotify Playlist
3) Twitter tweets about artist
4) Recommendation System

The Frontend will be written for you. Your job is to create an API proxy for Wikipedia, Spotify, and Twitter, and to also write a
recommendation system based on these features.
